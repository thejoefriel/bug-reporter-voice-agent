# Agent rules for this repo

## Prime directive
- Match existing patterns in this codebase. Do not introduce new architecture, new folders, or new libraries unless asked.
- Prefer reuse over creation: check for existing components, utilities, hooks, helpers, and patterns before adding new ones.

## Workflow
1) Read relevant code and docs first.
2) Produce a short plan (bullets) and list the files you will touch.
3) Wait for approval before making changes.
4) Execute one step at a time. After each step:
   - state what changed
   - why it changed
   - what to check next

## Safety and permissions
- Do not run terminal commands unless you ask first and I approve.
- If you think a command is necessary, propose the exact command and the reason.

## Simplicity
- Keep it simple. Avoid over-engineering, abstractions, and speculative future-proofing.
- Prefer small, readable functions. Avoid large functions and scattered comments when better naming will do.

## Logging and continuity
- Maintain /docs/ai/TASK_LOG.md as a running record:
  - date
  - goal
  - plan
  - decisions made
  - files changed
  - follow-ups / TODOs
- If context is missing or you are unsure, say so and point to which doc would resolve it.

## Testing
- Do not add or run tests unless asked.
- If changes create risk, propose what tests or checks I should run.
